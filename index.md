## Welcome to My Blog
Hi everyone.I'm Lakvindu and this site will be the place where I'll put everything I want to share with you guys.So look forward to it.

### Bit About Me
I'm currently a student in grade 12, which is equalant to High school 1st or 2nd year.I have many things I'm interested in.So the things I'll post be of various types.  
I think you should use an
`<Is this code?>` element here instead.
